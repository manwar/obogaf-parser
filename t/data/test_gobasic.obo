def: "A protein or a member of a complex that interacts selectively and non-covalently with a specific DNA sequence (sometimes referred to as a motif) within the regulatory region of a RNA polymerase II-transcribed gene to repress or decrease transcription. Regulatory regions include promoters (proximal and distal) and enhancers. Genes are transcriptional units." [GOC:txnOH-2018]
