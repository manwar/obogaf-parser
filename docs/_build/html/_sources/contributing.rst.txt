If you want to start working on an issue then please write short message on the issue tracker to prevent duplicate work.


Write Documentation
===================

obogaf::parser could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official obogaf::parser docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

obogaf::parser uses `Sphinx <https://sphinx-doc.org>`_ for the user manual (that you are currently reading).
See `doc_guidelines` on how the documentation reStructuredText is used.
See `doc_setup` on creating a local setup for building the documentation.


Submit Feedback
===============

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/marconotaro/obogaf-parser/issues

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

.. _doc_setup:

-------------------
Documentation Setup
-------------------

For building the documentation, you have to install the Python program Sphinx.
We use conda for that, see :ref:`conda`

Use the following steps for installing Sphinx and the dependencies for building the obogaf::parser documentation:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd obogaf-parser/docs
    $ conda create --name sphinx --file environment.yml
    $ source activate sphinx

Use the following for building the documentation.
If you are not in the sphinx environment (e.g. you uses ``source deactivate sphinx``) please activate the virtual environment using ``source activate sphinx``
Afterwards, you can always use ``make html`` for building.

.. code-block:: console

    (sphinx) $ cd obogaf-parser/docs
    (sphinx) $ make html  # rebuild for changed files only
    (sphinx) $ make clean && make html  # force rebuild

  .. code-block:: console

      $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

  Now you can make your changes locally.

4. When you're done making your changes, make sure that the build runs through.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cd docs && make clean && make html

5. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
